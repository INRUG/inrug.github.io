We are in the process of identifying potential members and setting up a first meeting soon. Krisztian and Vivek, after a few email exchanges, met on 29 Aug at Northern Lights brewery (yep!) for lunch to talk more and share their interests with each other. It sure is going to be a great group with tons to learn from.
