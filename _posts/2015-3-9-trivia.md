* Meeting on 7 March, 2015 at 4:00, Jepson 122, Gonzaga.
* In attendance: Nate Burch, Gary Chang, Stephen Hayes, Clark Kogan, Ryan McCulloch, Rollie Parrish, Vivek Patil, and Putter Tiatragul. 

* What happened: A very interesting trivia contest. (A big thanks to Clark for putting the questions together and for conducting it.) Participants were split into two teams and a series of questions asked. The team comprising Nate, Ryan and Vivek narrowly edged out the other team by two points. But, as they say these days... Everyone was a winner. 
* Thanks to the sponsorship by Revolution Analytics and their box of goodies (stickers, t-shirts, ...), the group enjoyed their paraphernalia and bottles of water. 
 
* Next meeting: April 3, 2015, Friday, at 4:00 pm, Gonzaga. Room, Jepson 120, unless a revision to this room number is made.  
* Key speaker: James Hallett on using `tidyr` and `dplyr` for tidying and munging data.
